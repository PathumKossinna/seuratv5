CCAIntegration(
  object = NULL,
  assay = NULL,

  new.reduction = "integrated.dr",
  reference = NULL,
  features = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{assay}{A vector of assay names specifying which assay to use when
constructing anchors. If NULL, the current default assay for each object is
used.}

\item{reference}{A vector specifying the object/s to be used as a reference
during integration. If NULL (default), all pairwise anchors are found (no
reference/s). If not NULL, the corresponding objects in \code{object.list}
will be used as references. When using a set of specified references, anchors
are first found between each query and each reference. The references are
then integrated through pairwise integration. Each query is then mapped to
the integrated reference.}

\item{normalization.method}{Name of normalization method used: LogNormalize
or SCT}

\item{dims}{Which dimensions to use from the CCA to specify the neighbor
search space}

\item{k.filter}{How many neighbors (k) to use when filtering anchors}

\item{verbose}{Print progress bars and output}
